## Soldering

For the TOP unit, all components are soldered from the back side.

### Soldering of the diodes
Insert the diodes D1 to D30 from the bottom side of the PCB, and solder from the front side of the PCB and cut the diode legs.

### Soldering of the MX hotswap socket
Solder the MX hotswap sockets while keeping them in place with tweezers.

### Soldering od the pin headers
Cut out two sets of 7 pins from the 40 pin headers, insert from the back side of the PCB and solder. Insert the long side of the pins.

## Intermediate assembly and soldering of sockets
If this is the first TOP unit that you have built, remove two sets of 7 pins from the remaining BASE unit pin headers, and insert them in the pin sockets of the TOP unit.

Place the TOP unit on the supports and secure it with the M3 screws excessed in base unit.
> [!NOTE]
>  Make sure that the legs of the pin sockets are inside the long through-holes of the base unit.
