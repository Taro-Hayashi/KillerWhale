## Soldering

For the TOP unit, all components are soldered from the back side.

### Soldering of the LEDs (optional)
The light emitting side of LEDs must be facing away.

### Soldering of the diodes
Insert the diodes D1 to D30, and secure them with masking tape.  
![](../img/top/IMG_6175.jpg)
Solder from the front side of the PCB and cut the diode legs.

### Soldering of the MX hotswap socket
Solder the MX hotswap sockets while keeping them in place with tweezers.

Once there is enough solder material on both sides of the socket so that it stays in place, you can put the tweezers aside and apply more solder.
Because of the relatively large surface, a lot of solder material is needed.

### Soldering od the pin headers
Cut out two sets of 7 pins from the 40 pin headers, insert from the back side of the PCB and solder. Insert the long side of the pins.

## Intermediate assembly and soldering of sockets
If this is the first TOP unit that you have built, remove two sets of 7 pins from the remaining BASE unit pin headers, and insert them in the pin sockets of the TOP unit.

From the BASE unit remaining items, thread M3 washers onto 4 M3 screws. 
![](../img/top/IMG_5631.jpg)  
Place the TOP unit on the supports and secure it with the M3 screws. Make sure that the legs of the pin sockets are inside the long through-holes of the base unit.

Solder the pin sockets from the back side of the base unit. Make sure to put enough solder to reach the front side of the base unit through the holes.
![](../img/top/IMG_5641.jpg)  
Attach MX switches to the switch plate, and insert them in the MX sockets. 
![](../img/top/IMG_5645.jpg)  
All switches are in place.

Confirm that everything is working by connecting the unit to a computer with a USB cable. 

The ADD unit is not mandatory. If you need it, proceed with the ADD unit build guide, otherwise proceed with the overall assembly guide
