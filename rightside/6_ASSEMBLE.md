The acrylic sheet and FR4 plate should fit together therefore be careful not exert too much force.
Insert black M2 screws into the 3 screw holes, and secure them with washers, spring washers and nuts.

Confirm that everything is working by connecting the unit to a computer with a USB cable. 
The LEDs will only work if the TOP unit is connected.
The direction of the scrolling can be configured later.
